# Loreto_Biological_Summary
Summary of biological data of 14 Rapid Inventories in Loreto


## Data Notes
* Mostly obtained from EMu but if the information wasn't available, we used the data from the Rapid Inventory books
* If the the information was approximate (e.g. >1000, ~500) we converted to the closest exact number for plotting purposes
* Fish data was obtained from Lesley
